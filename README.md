## Mission and Problem Statement

Our mission is to provide accurate, AI-powered economic recession predictions for African countries using machine learning. This application addresses the critical need for early warning systems that can help governments, investors, and policymakers make informed decisions about economic policies and investments. The model analyzes key economic indicators to predict recession likelihood, enabling proactive measures to mitigate economic downturns.

## Key Features

### Recession Risk Prediction:
Our mobile app allows the user to predict recession possibility in any  african economie by using factors such as population, Employment, and human capital. It also gives possible expert led strategies to remediate the situation based on  the severity of the result of the prediction.
